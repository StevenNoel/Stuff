# Nessus Tenable Automation API
This script can be used to query the Tenable/Nessus APIs.  Helps if you want to get/change all Scan/Asset information or even kick of Scans.

Can use something like that at the end of a Gold Master build or even upon computer startup to confirm regulations/compliances are in order on boot.
